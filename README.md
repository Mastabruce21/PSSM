# PSSM-v-0.1
Version 0.1
Pacman Self System Manintenance or "PSSM" is a script I wrote to help me keep pacman clean and upgraded, I thought others may find it useful
cd into the directory where you save "PSSM.SH"
run PSSM.SH using the following prompt: ./PSSM.SH
You may need to do a {chmod a+x} or {chmod 755} on PSSM.SH before you are able to run it
Thanks for using my script!
