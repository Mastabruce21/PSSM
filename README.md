# PSSM-v-0.1
Version 0.1
Pacman Self System Manintenance or "PSSM" is a script I wrote to help me keep pacman clean and upgraded, I thought others may find it useful
cd into the directory where you save "PSSM.sh"
run PSSM.sh using the following prompt: ./PSSM.sh
You may need to do a chmod a+x on PSSM.sh before you are able to run it
Thanks for using my script!
